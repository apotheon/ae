= AE -- Assertions Expressive

* http://protuils.rubyforge.org/ae


== DESCRIPTION

AE (Assertions Expressive) is an assertions library
intended for reuse by any TDD or BDD system.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Fluid notation.
* Core extensions to promote testing.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

AE offers a variety of nomenclatures, but by default uses
+assert+, +expect+ and +should+. Using fluid notation all
three methods have the same effect.

  1.assert == 1
  1.expect == 1
  1.should == 1

They differ however in their use when arguments and/or a block
is supplied.

=== Assert

The #assert method checks for truth if a single argument is given.

  assert(true)

Or if a lone block is given.

  assert{true}

If both an argument and a block are given then it uses equality (ie. ==)
to compare them.

  assert(1){1}

=== Expect

The #expect method works by comparing the receiver to the argument or block,
but uses broad equality (#equate?).

  Numeric.expect(5)

  Numeric.expect{5}

If both an argument and a block are given, then it compares the argument to
the return value of the block.

  expect(Numeric){3}

=== Should

The #should method work like this:

  should "evalute as true" do
    true
  end

All other optional subjunctive nomenclatures (eg. must, shall, will) work exactly
like #should.


== HOW TO INSTALL

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  gem install ae

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:
