= A.E. -- Assertive Expressive

* http://protuils.rubyforge.org/ae


== DESCRIPTION

Assertions Expressive (A.E.) is an assertions framework
intended for reuse by any TDD, BDD or similar system.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Clear, simple and concise syntax.
* Uses higher-order functions and fluid notation.
* Reusable core extensions ease assertion construction.
* Core extensions are stable and standardized via Ruby Facets.
* Facets is an optional dependency; extensions are built-in.
* Easily extensible allowing for alternate notations.
* Eats it's own dog food.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

AE defines the method +assert+. It's is compatible with the method
as defined by Test::Unit and minitest, which verifies truth of a
single argument (and can accept an optional failure message).

  assert(true)

In addition AE's +assert+ method has been extended to accept a block,
the result of which is likewise verified.

  assert{true}

But these are simply legacy compatibility modes. The true power the
AE's +assert+ method, lies in it's use without argument or block.
In this case, it returns an +Assertor+ instance. An +Assertor+ is an
Assertion Functor, or Higher-Order Function, which is a function
that operates on another function. With it we can make assertions
like:

  x.assert == y

  a.assert.include? e

  StandardError.assert.raised? do
    ...
  end

And so forth. AE's abilities in this areas are quite extensive.
You are encouraged to read the QEDocs to learn more.
