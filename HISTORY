= RELEASE HISTORY

== 1.2.3 / 2010-06-07

This release is a quick fix, which adds a missing `require 'yaml'`.


== 1.2.2 / 2010-06-06

Version 1.2.2 simply add one new feature --the ability to
use 'object.assert = other' instead of 'object.assert == other'.
This was added simply becuase I found I often made the mistake
of a missing '=', and since #assert= has no definition, there
was no reason not to have behave accordingly.

Also note that I switched the license from LGPL to MIT.
With regards to reusable libraries and I moving all my
work, such that I am able, to MIT to maximize free usage.

Changes:

* Add `#assert=` method as a shortcut for `#assert ==`.
* Now distributed under MIT license.


== 1.2.0 / 2010-01-27

This release fixes '=~' assertions and now requires the
ae/expect library by default.

Changes:

* Expect method is now loaded by default when requiring 'ae'.
* Fixed bug where #=~ did not work correctly against Assertor.


== 1.1.0 / 2009-09-06

This release provided two major imporvements. The first is
the #expect method which is similar to #assert, but uses 
case equality (#===) for comparison. And second, an optional
library <tt>ae/legacy.rb<tt>, is has been added that provides
backward compatibility with Test::Unit assertions, should it
be needed.

Changes:

* New #expect method.
* Proved legacy assertion in optional ae/legacy.rb library.
* Added backtrace parameter to flunk calls.


== 1.0.0 / 2009-09-03

This is the initial release of AE.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
